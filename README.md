# Sprint-4-Project-Triple-Ten
# Streamlit Web Application for Vehicle Data Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying essential software engineering practices to enhance your data skills and improve your appeal to potential employers. The main tasks include creating and managing Python virtual environments, developing a web application, and deploying it to a publicly accessible cloud service.

While the project used a dataset of car sales advertisements, the emphasis was not on the dataset or its analysis. You are encouraged to select any dataset that aligns with your interests.

## Steps Involved

### Step 1: Project Prerequisites

- Created a GitHub account and initialized a new repository with README.md and .gitignore files.
- Installed necessary packages including pandas, streamlit, and plotly-express.
- Created a Render.com account and linked it to GitHub.
- Installed and configured VS Code, setting the Python interpreter to match the virtual environment.

### Step 2: Data Acquisition

- Downloaded the car details dataset (cardata.csv) and placed it in the root directory of the project.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

- Created an EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook to conduct exploratory data analysis.
- Created histograms and scatterplots using the plotly-express library.
- The visualizations were first prototyped in Jupyter notebook and then integrated into the web application.

### Step 4: Web Application Development

- Created an app.py file in the root directory of the project.
- Imported necessary modules like streamlit, pandas, and plotly_express.
- Loaded the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Incorporated various streamlit components into the app like headers, histograms, scatter plots, and checkboxes.
- Updated README file to include a basic project description and instructions for other users to run the project on their local machine.

### Step 5: Deployment to Render

- Added a streamlit configuration file to the GitHub repository.
- Created a new web service linked to the GitHub repository in Render.
- Configured the Render web service to install necessary packages and run the app.py file.
- Deployed the final version of the application on Render.
- Verified the application's accessibility.

## Conclusion

This Streamlit application offers an interactive visualization of the Vehicle dataset. It was created as part of a project to practice key software engineering tasks, including setting up Python virtual environments, developing a web application, and deploying it on a cloud service.
